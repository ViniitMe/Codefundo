Microsoft Hackathon : A solution to disaster management


Aim  |  Motivation

We aim to provide a solution to check/curb the corruption at different administrative levels indulged in receiving and transferring of relief funds.
Here, a few instances are listed where corruption led to worsening the plight of the needy people.


- Tsunami (December 2004):
 Studies  say that only about one third of the reconstruction aid that was promised after the tsunami had actually been distributed, and a large portion of the amount had been wasted due to corruption, mismanagement and unnecessary duplication of aid efforts. As a result, hundreds of tsunami survivors continue to wait for permanent homes.
- Bhuj Debris Scam :
193 government officials were found to be responsible for 13 crores scam in debris removal project.  


Our Solution

We are aiming to develop an application which will keep an eye on the real-time transactions of the relief funds and document the proposals promised by the officials at different administrative levels along with the funds allocated to each of the proposals. 


Working

At the time of the project announcement for the relief purposes of the mass affected by disaster, the upper body will be asked to share the exact figures of the funding and the plans. All the data regarding the fund allocated for each plan and the fund sent to the lower bodies will be stored in the database. In the second stage, the fund receiving body will update the database with the values like received fund from the higher level, money allocated by this body to different plans and activities. The same procedure will be followed till we arrive at the base level.
All the data will be kept encrypted such that the values which will be fed will be known only to the concerned department at that level.
Once the project period gets over, difference between the allocated and received fund will be estimated and divulged, corresponding to the different administrative levels and hence, the nodes are identified where mismatch of fund is there. The concerned officials will have to answer the same and provide the money which they kept with themselves.
Possibly, if this idea emerges out to be a success, then in future even due to the fear, the corruption rate is expected to die down and if things are to be documented on a very long term basis for the purpose of checking once relief period is over, the officials are expected to think more wisely before they make any proposals.
